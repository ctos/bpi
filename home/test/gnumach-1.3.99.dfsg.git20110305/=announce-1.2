I am pleased to announce version 1.2 of the GNU distribution of the
Mach kernel.  It may be found in the file (about 3.64 MB compressed)
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnumach/gnumach-1.2.tar.gz.

Because of extensive source reorganization, it is not profitable to
provide diffs against previous versions.

Most notably, this release updates the Linux-derived device drivers to
those found in Linux version 2.0.36.

This distribution is only for i386, i486, i586 (pentium), and i686
(sexium [pentium pro]) processors on PC-AT compatible machines.
Volunteers interested in ports to other architectures are eagerly
sought.

MiG (the Mach Interface Generator) is no longer in this distribution;
it is now distributed separately.  You will need MiG in order to be
able to compile this release.

Bug reports relating to this distribution should be sent to
bug-hurd@gnu.org.  Requests for assistance should be made on
help-hurd@gnu.org. 

The md5sum checksums for this distibution is
