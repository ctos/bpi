I am pleased to announce version 1.0 of the GNU distribution of the
Mach kernel.  It may be found in the file (about 2.54 MB compressed)
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gnumach-1.0.tar.gz.

This distribution was prepared in order to install some bug fixes and
minor improvements (not worth noting here) to the Utah microkernel,
and to make the package conform to the GNU coding standards, at least
minimally, as regards configuration.  This was based upon the UK22
distribution, with some modifications made at Utah as well.

This kernel will be in the forthcoming complete binary distribution of
GNU.  The release is being made now, in the hopes that any serious
problems we didn't notice might be found in advance of that
distribution.  Volunteers who are interested in compiling this release
should do so, and please report any problems asap.

All the non-kernel pieces of the Utah distribution are not present in
this distribution, except for the MiG interface generator which is
still supplied.  These other pieces were never used for GNU, and are
not really part of the kernel at all.  We may separate MiG into a
separate distribution for convenience at some later date.

This distribution is only for i386, i486, i586 (pentium), and i686
(sexium [pentium pro]) processors on PC-AT compatible machines.
Volunteers interested in ports to other architectures are eagerly
sought.

Most ethernet cards and disk controllers are supported by this kernel;
ones for which Linux drivers exist can be ported easily.  Non-network
devices for which BSD drivers exist can be ported with a little
effort, but not much.

Bug reports relating to this distribution should be sent to
bug-hurd@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Requests for assistance should be made on
help-hurd@prep.ai.mit.edu.
