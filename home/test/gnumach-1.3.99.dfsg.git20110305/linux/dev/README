This hierarchy used to contain modified files, based on files from the
Linux kernel, as opposed to `../src/' containing only files that have not
been modified (or have only been modified marginally).  This policy is
NOT adhered to any further, so please don't change (or even add) files
below here, but instead merge the files in here back into `../src/'
(which should really be called `../linux-2.0' or similar) or even better
--- when adding large chunks --- create a more suitable hierarchy like
we've done with `../pcmcia-cs/'.
