I am pleased to announce version 1.1.1 of the GNU distribution of the
Mach kernel.  It may be found in the file (about 254 MB compressed)
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gnumach-1.1.1.tar.gz.

Diffs from version 1.0 of this distribution are avaiable at
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gnumach-1.0-1.1.1.diff.gz (about 169 MB
compressed). 

Version 1.1 had some minor accidental problems and is being removed in
favor of this minor update.

This is a bug-fixing release; the only new feature over version 1.0 is
the --enable-kdb configure option which has been added to turn on
kernel debugging support.

Several bugs have been fixed in this distribution, particularly
relating to cross-compilation support.  

This distribution is only for i386, i486, i586 (pentium), and i686
(sexium [pentium pro]) processors on PC-AT compatible machines.
Volunteers interested in ports to other architectures are eagerly
sought.

Most ethernet cards and disk controllers are supported by this kernel;
ones for which Linux drivers exist can be ported easily.  Non-network
devices for which BSD drivers exist can be ported with a little
effort, but not much.

Bug reports relating to this distribution should be sent to
bug-hurd@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Requests for assistance should be made on
help-hurd@prep.ai.mit.edu.
